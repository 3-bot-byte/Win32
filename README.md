# Win32
A new virus thing i made but this one is slightly more powerful because of one line lol 
But keep in mind even tho this is very baseline malware i would still run it in a vm becuase it turns off your pc after 60 seconds and can cause corruption
to your files if turn off at the wrong time i recommend 
1. VMware Workstation
2. Oracle VirtualBox
3. Windows Sandbox
for a Vm
but have fun with this and tell me stuff to add ðŸ™‚
